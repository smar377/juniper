1. Salt Installation
==========================================================================

The easiest way to set up Salt is through a bootstrap script:

- https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/salt_bootstrap.html

To install Salt on the master server, issue the following commands:

$ curl -o bootstrap_salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
$ sudo sh bootstrap_salt.sh -M

Output is omitted for brevity. The installation will take a minute or so. When it completes, you can check the Salt version by using the following command:

$ salt --version

On the minion1 server, install Salt by performing similar steps, but for this time do not use the –M key:

$ curl -o bootstrap_salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
$ sudo sh bootstrap_salt.sh

$ salt-minion --version

NOTE: By default, the bootstrap script installs the latest stable Salt version, so it may differ from the 2018.3.2 that is used for this chapter. This will typically not be a problem. However, you can enforce the installation of a specific Salt version, if you wish, by modifying the second command as follows: 

$ sudo sh bootstrap_salt.sh -M git v2018.3.2

(this is for master; for minion, omit the –M key).
